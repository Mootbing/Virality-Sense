Icon Placeholder - Please Create Icons

You need to create three PNG icon files for the Chrome extension:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels) - Used in the extension toolbar
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels) - Used in the extension management page
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels) - Used in the Chrome Web Store

Design Recommendations:
- Use a purple gradient (#667eea to #764ba2) to match the extension theme
- Icon ideas: Star, trending arrow, video camera, chart going up
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use transparent background (PNG format)

Quick Solution:
You can use emoji as a temporary icon by converting them to PNG at the required sizes.
Try: ‚≠ê (star), üìà (chart), üé• (camera), or üî• (fire)

Once you have created your icons, place them in this directory and delete this file.
